  <p class="text-muted">The nature of Christian schools varies enormously from country to country, according to the religious, educational, and political cultures. In some countries, there is a strict separation of church and state, so all religious schools are private; in others, there is an established church whose teachings form an integral part of the state-operated educational system; in yet others, the state subsidizes religious schools of various denominations.[1]</p>

    <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely shocked when I got to know that I’ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. At the time when I participated for the very first time so I didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I’d do more hard work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision to participate again, Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation, I was not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten this prize, My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known that hard work is most important to achieve success. </p>
